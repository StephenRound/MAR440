#### Final Project
---
##### Collaboration with Haley Tatalovich

###### The basis
We wanted to take the concept behind my Project 1 Sculpture and push it into a much bigger and grandiose experience. Our goal is to have this sketch projected on at least one wall within an adequate space. For the more ambitious route, we'd like to have it triple projected around an entire room, using the same setup as having three screens that the sketch could move around in freely.

###### The obstacles
Our biggest obstacle is finding the space to present this, as well as finding the right equipment to properly display it. Other than that, our sketch is mostly ironed out and we're proud to show it
